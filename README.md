# Weekday Guessing Game

A Python-based educational game suite designed to help users practice and master calendar calculations, including the Doomsday algorithm and weekday determination skills.

## Features

The application includes several game modes:

1. **Current Year Game**
   - Practice determining weekdays for random dates in the current year
   - Instant feedback on accuracy and timing
   - Great for building basic calendar skills

2. **Custom Year Range Game**
   - Similar to Current Year Game but allows practice across any year range
   - Customizable from 1700 to 2100
   - Perfect for developing historical date calculation skills

3. **Doomsday Game**
   - Practice calculating the Doomsday for different years
   - Includes comprehensive explanation of the Doomsday algorithm
   - Essential for mastering calendar calculations

4. **Date Rush Games**
   - Two variants: Current Year and Custom Range
   - 60-second time limit challenge
   - Focus on speed and accuracy under pressure
   - Track your improvement with detailed statistics

5. **Month Number Game**
   - Practice associating month names with their numbers
   - 60-second time limit
   - Prevents consecutive repetition of the same month
   - Great for building basic calendar literacy

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- tkinter (usually comes with Python)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository or download the source code
2. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system
3. No additional package installation required as the game uses standard library modules
